# Python Hello World

Welcome to Python with ALX! In this repository, you'll find a collection of Python programs, along with a splash of C code to complement them.

## Files üìÇ

Below are the files and directories in this repository:

- **HELPER_FILES** üôå

  - [lists.h](./lists.h): This is the header file used by the C files in this repository.

- **C** üêç

  - [10-check_cycle.c](./10-check_cycle.c): Contains the following function:
    ```c
    int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
    ```
    This function checks if a linked list has a cycle in it.

- **PYTHON** üêç

  - [100-write.py](./100-write.py): This script prints a specified string to stderr.
  - [102-magic_calculation.py](./102-magic_calculation.py): Implements a function that performs the same task as the provided bytecode.
  - [2-print.py](./2-print.py): Prints a string.
  - [3-print_number.py](./3-print_number.py): Uses the provided source code to print a number.
  - [4-print_float.py](./4-print_float.py): Uses the provided source code to print a float.
  - [5-print_string.py](./5-print_string.py): Uses the source code to print a string three times and then the first nine characters of the string.
  - [6-concat.py](./6-concat.py): Concatenates part of the source code to print a specified string.
  - [7-edges.py](./7-edges.py): Demonstrates slicing using the source code.
  - [8-concat_edges.py](./8-concat_edges.py): Uses slicing and concatenation to print a specified string from the source code.
  - [9-easter_egg.py](./9-easter_egg.py): Prints the Zen of Python.

- **SHELL** üêö
  - [0-run](./0-run): Contains a shell script that runs a Python script stored in the $PYFILE environmental variable.
  - [1-run_inline](./1-run_inline): Contains a shell script that runs Python code stored in the $PYCODE environmental variable.
  - [101-compile](./101-compile): Contains a script that compiles a Python source code.

This repository is a combination of Python and C code, showcasing various Python scripts and C functions. Feel free to explore and learn from the code provided.
