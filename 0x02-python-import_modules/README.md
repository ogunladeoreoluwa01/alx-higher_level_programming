## Project Description
This project consists of various tasks related to Python programming, import statements, modules, and command-line arguments. Each task has specific requirements and objectives that aim to enhance your Python programming skills. The tasks range from importing functions from modules to building a basic calculator and working with command-line arguments.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Import a Simple Function
Write a program that imports a simple function from a file and prints the result of the addition of two numbers.

### Task 1: My First Toolbox
Write a program that imports functions from a file, performs mathematical operations, and prints the results.

### Task 2: How to Make a Script Dynamic
Create a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.

### Task 3: Infinite Addition
Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments, including handling large numbers.

### Task 4: Who Are You?
Write a program that prints all the names defined in a compiled module, excluding names starting with '__'.

### Task 5: Everything Can Be Imported
Write a program that imports a variable from a file and prints its value.

### Task 6: Build My Own Calculator
Create a program that imports functions from a file and performs basic calculator operations based on user input.

### Task 7: Easy Print
Write a program that prints a specific message using a maximum of two lines.

### Task 8: ByteCode to Python
Write a Python function that mimics the behavior of given Python bytecode.

### Task 9: Fast Alphabet
Create a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase without using loops, conditional statements, string literals, or system calls.
