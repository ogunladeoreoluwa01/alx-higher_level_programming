# Python Classes: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview
Welcome to the **0x06-PYTHON-CLASSES** directory! Here, we dive into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. In OOP, everything is viewed as objects or unique entities, bringing a paradigm shift from the procedural style of older languages like C. At the core of OOP is the concept of a **class**.

## What is a Class?
A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. It serves as a template that defines a set of attributes and methods common to all objects of a certain type. Think of it like a recipe for creating objects with shared characteristics.

### Example: The Rich Class
Just like in real life where a group of individuals with a common attribute, say wealth, forms the "rich class," in programming, we can create a class to represent this shared attribute. Here, the class becomes a container for both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) related to wealth.

```python
class RichClass:
    def __init__(self, money):
        self.money = money

    def display_wealth(self):
        print(f"This person has ${self.money}.")

# Creating instances (objects) of the RichClass
person1 = RichClass(1000000)
person2 = RichClass(500000)

# Accessing and using class attributes and methods
person1.display_wealth()  # Output: This person has $1000000.
person2.display_wealth()  # Output: This person has $500000.
```

## Key Concepts Covered in this Directory
- **Attributes:** Properties that store data within a class.
- **Methods:** Functions associated with a class, enabling specific behaviors.
- **Object Instances:** Individual objects created from a class blueprint.
- **Accessing Attributes and Methods:** Utilizing the data and behaviors defined within a class.
- **Encapsulation:** Controlling access to certain attributes and methods to protect data integrity.
- **Inheritance:** Creating new classes by inheriting attributes and methods from existing ones.
- **Polymorphism:** Using a single interface to represent different types of objects.

## Why OOP in Python?
1. **Modularity:** Code is organized into classes, promoting a modular and reusable structure.
2. **Readability:** Object-oriented code tends to be more readable and easier to understand.
3. **Encapsulation:** Data and methods are encapsulated within a class, enhancing data security.
4. **Inheritance:** Reuse code by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes.
5. **Polymorphism:** Enables flexibility by allowing objects of different classes to be used interchangeably.
