# 0X07-TEST_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT

Welcome to the `0X07-TEST_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT` directory! Here, we introduce the concept of **tests**. When developing code or functions, it's crucial to ensure they adhere to certain rules and handle various cases. We cannot predict who will use our code in the future, so thorough testing helps prevent errors and maintains our reputation. Remember, even small mistakes, like a misplaced semicolon in C, can have significant consequences!

## Purpose

The primary goal of this directory is to provide a structured approach to testing our code. By creating comprehensive test cases, we can verify the correctness and robustness of our functions. Our aim is to cover as many scenarios as possible to ensure our code performs reliably.

## Directory Structure

- **tests**: This folder contains test files corresponding to different functions. Each test file is named appropriately to indicate the function it tests.
- **feedback**: We appreciate your feedback! If you notice any missing test cases or have suggestions for improvement, please leave your feedback in this folder.

## Contributing

Your contributions are valuable! If you identify any test cases that are missing or have ideas to enhance our testing strategy, we encourage you to contribute. Simply follow the guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

## Feedback

We strive for excellence in our testing practices. If you explore this directory and discover any overlooked test cases, please let us know! Your feedback helps us improve the quality and reliability of our code.

Thank you for your interest and contributions to the `0X07-TEST_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT` directory. Together, we can ensure the integrity and effectiveness of our codebase.
