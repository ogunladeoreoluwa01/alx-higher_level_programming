# Python Inheritance

Congratulations! You've now unlocked your share of Dad's wealth. In Python, inheritance allows us to share attributes, functions, and methods from one class to another. The parent class generously shares or gives away its methods, attributes, and more to the child class.

But wait, there's more! Similar to the prodigal son, the child class has the freedom to do whatever it wants with the inherited attributes and methods. Sometimes, it behaves like a good child and uses them as they are. Other times, it rebels and overrides them with its own meanings. Quite rebellious, isn't it?

This directory is dedicated to learning about inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and how to use it wisely. Pay close attention because you might encounter it again when we delve into JavaScript.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
