# Python Input and Output

This directory is focused on Python input and output operations. Input and output (I/O) operations are essential for any programming language as they allow interaction with the user and the external environment.

In Python, input operations are used to receive data from the user, while output operations are used to display data to the user or write it to external files.

Here, we will explore various aspects of Python input and output, including:

1. Reading input from the user using the `input()` function.
2. Displaying output to the user using the `print()` function.
3. Writing data to files using file handling operations.
4. Reading data from files using file handling operations.
5. Formatting input and output for better readability and presentation.

By mastering input and output operations in Python, you will be equipped to build interactive programs, process external data, and create versatile applications.
