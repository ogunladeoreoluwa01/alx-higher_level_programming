# ALX Higher-Level Programming - Python

This repository contains solutions to various tasks in the ALX Higher-Level Programming track, specifically in Python. Each task is a Python script or function designed to demonstrate different programming concepts and skills.

## Task List

### 0. Positive or Negative

- A Python program that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

### 1. The Last Digit

- A Python program that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints the last digit of the number along with specific messages based on the last digit's value.

### 2. Print Alphabet

- A Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, all on the same line without a new line character.

### 3. Print Alphabet Except q and e

- A Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e,' all on the same line without a new line character.

### 4. Hexadecimal Printing

- A Python program that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal format.

### 5. 00...99

- A Python program that prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by commas and spaces, with two-digit formatting.

### 6. Print Combinations

- A Python program that prints all possible combinations of two digits, avoiding repetitions and in ascending order.

### 7. Is Lower

- A Python function `islower(c)` that checks if a character `c` is lowercase and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.

### 8. Uppercase

- A Python function `uppercase(str)` that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

### 9. Print Last Digit

- A Python function `print_last_digit(number)` that prints the last digit of a given number and returns the value of the last digit.

### 10. Add Two Integers

- A Python function `add(a, b)` that adds two integers and returns the result.

### 11. Power Function

- A Python function `pow(a, b)` that computes `a` raised to the power of `b` and returns the result.

### 12. Fizz Buzz

- A Python function `fizzbuzz()` that prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz."

### 13. Insert in Sorted Linked List

- A C function `insert_node(listint_t **head, int number)` that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list and returns the address of the new node or `NULL` if it fails.

## Usage

To run any of the Python scripts, simply execute them in your terminal, e.g., `./0-positive_or_negative.py`.

For the C function in task 13, it can be compiled and executed as shown in the example provided in the task description.

Feel free to explore and use these solutions for your learning and reference purposes.
